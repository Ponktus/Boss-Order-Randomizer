# Boss-Order-Randomizer
This is my first approach at a Super metroid Item Randomizer, introducing a special feature: The Boss Order Randomizer!

## Description

This randomizer functions like a normal full item randomizer. Both major and minor items can potentially be at any spot.
However, in addition to that the randomizer also picks a random boss order out of 24 possible ones and forces this boss order onto the player by positioning grey doors in front of the bosses that only unlock if you have beaten the previous boss in line.
Thus the routing will not only be about getting into an item-gomode as quick as possible but also figuring out the boss order quickly and that way make for a unqiue routing experience.

## Current status of the project

The randomizer does kinda work. It randomizes the items and bosses. Lots of testing had to be done though and there are still alot of crashes.

## Goals for version 1.0

- Having all 24 boss orders properly implemented.
- Having a solid logic with medium difficulty.

## Goals for eventual future version

Adaptable difficulty settings, a seperate mode where the Boss order is revealed based on the starting items and being able to run the randomizer from an exe.
